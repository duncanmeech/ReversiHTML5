ReversiHTML5
============

A complete implementation of a reversi engine and UI in Javascript / HTML5

This was one of my first Javascript apps so I apologize for gross violations of style etc.
More recently I"ve updated this engine and made it part of smartlittlegames.com where it is used as the computer A.I 
and also to validate and adjudicate moves between two human users.
